Stop manually writing down recruits yourself.

EA College Football 25's 35 recruit limit means making some hard decisions about who to track and who to take off. It's hard to remember who that fallback player was now that your first choice committed somewhere else, but you had to take them off so you could scout some guys at a different position. And when you did go to scout some new guys, you end up adding a bunch of guys that you forgot you had already scouted, because the recruit menu gives no indication of who you've already seen. Now you have to go through the removal animation, go back to the full list (which has reset the last filters you had) and try again.

Enter GameTape. GameTape works alongside game streaming to ingest everything about recruiting that you can't remember yourself. As you scroll through the menu, GameTape will make note of every player's name, position, archetype, star value, and class designation. This data is saved to a CSV file that you can build on however you want. Track player's gem status, their offer status, or notes about their potential, ratings, and abilities. Spend your time making the important decisions, and leave the data collection to GameTape.
